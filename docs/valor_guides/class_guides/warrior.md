Odd Choices at first glance these 2 helms do have a use, And that is turrning warrior into a support class.
    
   - The Helm of dark retruibtion is gernraly better for healing due to its lack of a cooldown and high heal.
    
   - Burden was orgainally a very bad helm but a recent buff has made it far more useable burden is more usefull if you can deal with the cooldown and with enough    wisdom you could be able to perma buff its stun.


# Heavy Armors

**Heavy Armors Generally have high defense while lacking other stats**

The Odyssey and Plate of Righteous Fury Are the main DPS armors you'll be using, providing large amounts of luck and might. The Odyssey has slightly more DPS then Fury but loses out on Furys massive 150 HP Bonus. While Fury has a large HP boost the Warriors already high HP makes it slightly less appealing then Odyssey. Overall if you want DPS these are great and won't break the bank.

The V-L Spark Armor is an interesting choice not being subpared in really any aspect besides its +8 Fortune boost. You'll mainly want to swap to this item before the boss dies to utilize the fortune bonus. It is also the only Heavy Armour besides AR Helldom Earth to give life steal. While not excelling in any stat it is a tolerable main armor if you want the life steal or fortune.

One of the more useless armors, Stoneplate gives no dps meaning its only viable use is on a Support Warr runnning Burden of the Warpawn.

The Helldom is extremely powerful, offering high DPS stats on equip and large survivability. The only downside of using Helldom is its extreme rarity with a measly 18 total drops Losing it makes it almost **unrecoverable**. While most would rather use this armor on Knight, The Warrior is still a very good choice for it.
