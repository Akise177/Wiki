# Swords

**Swords are short range weapons with genrealy high dmg**

![dblade](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c90692d08e593345f69dd8cd423552ece38669c9d0f52379273c2f10d55a39c8/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f626c6164652532306f66253230746865253230756e646572776f726c64)

Just looking at the stats you should be able to tell why this sword is so often used; It provides some of the highest dps of LG swords at a decent true range, It is also very afordable due to it being an esscence craft.

While medorice at first sight The Undead Nemiesis is a surpisingly viable sword with DPS simalr to Underworld and with a straight shot pattern this sword is a very good option. It also Provides the BIS Speed of any sword

While not normally used in acutally combat Bejewled Spear and Shaylee are great for thier fortunte +4 and +2 repictivly. It is not advised to main these swords instead switch to them before the boss dies to gain the fortune.

![slash](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d6c2fd21f61cea5eb35b98fe1af545aa1d8441316983b47d47e726674ef3c11a/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f6d616c69676e616e74253230736c6173686572)

The pinacle of LG swords the slasher provides great DPS at a large 6.6 range, Do note that slashers large damge range makes its DPS less consinsitent compared to other swords. The only downside is its price tag compared to other swords. 

![axe](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/aaa8e970e7e4b5955af5af105a09da6f6748f0156ee877b5806d8f65007da09a/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f7761726178652532306f662532306a756467656d656e74)

The Waraxe is a sitting sword simlar to that of pixie from prod, Its DPS is the highest of all lg swords surpassing even non enchated clranet. Take cuation when using or you will get a swift death **THIS SHOULD NEVER BE YOUR ONLY SWORD.**

![ar](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e6792501788b1be3088d01fd6a57fe8ea4c171a8258a3c27e9ae3f779bb5ba25/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f436c6172656e74)

What is thier really to say its the AR sword of course its goining to be great; You have staggring high dps at a sericvable 4 range. Like slasher the only real downside is how rare and costly this item is

      Air For constinet dps 
      Fire for critical damge
      Water for longer range
      Earth for a massive hp pool


![garg](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a6348ede5d78b9c35acd5fe3caa5a3268957d6accfd7c513a3b369f04f4bae56/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f676172676f796c6525323063727573686572)

Unimpressive DPS wise this sword shines with it's potinal burst dmg and heafty **+100% HP** doubling the warriors alredy high hp, It's also wont hurt your gold stack costing around the 70k mark due to being decently common drop from a heavly ran dungon.


![gem](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/dfe08ae90b548b1ab06826e23c522f4e9d152424184cb8fa9c36ad32048c5114/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f67656d25323073776f7264)

Not much to say about this sword its an upgraded crystal sword sacrifing a good ammont of DPS for range of 6.6, If you dont have a slasher and need range this is the sword for you however if you have slasher this sword gets completly obslted.


# Helmets

Odd Choices at first glance these 2 helms do have a use, And that is turrning warrior into a support class.
    
   - The Helm of dark retruibtion is gernraly better for healing due to its lack of a cooldown and high heal.
    
   - Burden was orgainally a very bad helm but a recent buff has made it far more useable burden is more usefull if you can deal with the cooldown and with enough    wisdom you could be able to perma buff its stun.


# Heavy Armors

**Heavy Armors Generally have high defense while lacking other stats**

The Odyssey and Plate of Righteous Fury Are the main DPS armors you'll be using, providing large amounts of luck and might. The Odyssey has slightly more DPS then Fury but loses out on Furys massive 150 HP Bonus. While Fury has a large HP boost the Warriors already high HP makes it slightly less appealing then Odyssey. Overall if you want DPS these are great and won't break the bank.

The V-L Spark Armor is an interesting choice not being subpared in really any aspect besides its +8 Fortune boost. You'll mainly want to swap to this item before the boss dies to utilize the fortune bonus. It is also the only Heavy Armour besides AR Helldom Earth to give life steal. While not excelling in any stat it is a tolerable main armor if you want the life steal or fortune.

One of the more useless armors, Stoneplate gives no dps meaning its only viable use is on a Support Warr runnning Burden of the Warpawn.

The Helldom is extremely powerful, offering high DPS stats on equip and large survivability. The only downside of using Helldom is its extreme rarity with a measly 18 total drops Losing it makes it almost **unrecoverable**. While most would rather use this armor on Knight, The Warrior is still a very good choice for it.
